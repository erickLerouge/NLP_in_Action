### Erick Velazquez Ph.D.

This repository contains the code of the book: Natural language processing in Action by Hobson Lane, Cole Howard and Hannes Max Hapke.

In November 2021, I decided to learn neural networks to do NLP. So I read this book and reprogrammed the exercices. There are some differences
since I found little errors. Monstly typos on the code. There is also a file with the requirements so this code should be easy to re execute. 
I also added comments to the code so it is clearer what is it doing. In some cases, the authors invite the readers to explores further the code. I did so. So you will find some extra code here as well.
